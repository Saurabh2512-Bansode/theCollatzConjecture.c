Assignment Details:

The Collatz conjecture concerns what happens when we take any positive integer n and apply the following algorithm:

n = (n/2)       if n is even;
n = 3 * n + 1   if n is odd;

The conjecture states that when this algorithm is continually applied, all positive integers will eventually reach 1. 
For example, if n=35, the sequence is

35, 106, 53, 160, 80, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1

Write a C program using the fork() system call that generates this sequence in the child process. 
The starting number will be provided from the command line. 
For example, if 8 is passed as a parameter on the command line, the child process will output 8, 4, 2, 1. 
Have the parent invoke the wait() call to wait for the child process to complete before exiting the program. 
Perform necessary error checking to ensure that a positive integer is passed on the command line.

Programmer-to-User Instructions:

hailstone.c: This is the C program for the Collatz conjecture.
hailstone: This file is the compiled file for hailstone.c.

Program Discription:    See assignment details at top of page...

Program Notes:          The child process will output the sequence of numbers generated from the algorithm specified by the Collatz conjecture. 
                        This works because the parent and child processes have their own copies of the data. 
                        
                        The program perfoms fork(), then enters into a if loop and if pid == 1 (if it is busy) then it 
                        waits till it equals 0 (not busy). When it is 0 then it can perform the calculations. It checks
                        to see if it is even or odd and performs the appropriate equation. This repeats until it reaches
                        one, then it breaks out of the loop.
                
To start the program:   To run the assignment go to the terminal and find the directory that contains
                        the compiled hailstone file. To run the hailstone program type ./hailstone.

Using the program:      First the program will prompt the user to "Enter a positive number to plug into 
                        the Collatz function." So type in your positive number and press enter and it 
                        should print the return of the Collatz funtion on the desired number.
                        
ENJOY THE HAILSTONE PROGRAM!!!
